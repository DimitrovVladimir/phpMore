# Basic sintax php

With solving this problems, I practice working php basic sintax.

## Problem: RGB Table
Write a PHP script that draws a table with 3 columns, with captions – Red, Green and Blue, and 5 rows, each having as background 1 of 5 shades of those colors. Increase the color index by 51 for each row. For example, for the Red Column it will be:

•	RGB(51, 0, 0)

•	RGB(102, 0, 0)

•	RGB(153, 0, 0)

•	. . .


The caption columns should NOT be colored. Each cell of the table has width and height equal to 50px and has 1px solid black border.

## Problem: 50 Shades of Grey

Write a PHP script that generates 5 rows of 10 <div> elements, each having as background a different shade of grey – resulting in 50 shades of grey. Every row starts with a color index – a multiple of 51. 
•	First row – 0, 
•	Second row – 51, 
•	Third row – 102 … 
Then you need to print 10 divs, each increasing that index with 5.
•	First row – 0, 5, 10…
•	Second row – 51, 56, 61…
The color index needs to be applied to all parameters of the RGB function. Example: rgb(51, 51, 51);
